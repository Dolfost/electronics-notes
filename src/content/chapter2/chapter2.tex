\section{Basic Circuit Components}
\subsection{Wires, Cables, and Connectors}
Wires and cables provide low-resistance pathways for electric currents. Most
electrical wires are made from copper or silver and typically are protected
by an insulating coating of plastic, rubber, or lacquer. Cables consist of a
number of individually insulated wires bound together to form a
multiconductor transmission line. Connectors, such as plugs, jacks, and
adapters, are used as mating fasteners to join wires and cable with other
electrical devices. \cite{practical_electronics}

\subsubsection{Skin Effect}
The movement of electrons toward the surface of a wire under high-frequency
conditions is called the \emph{skin effect}. At low frequencies, the skin effect does
not have a large effect on the conductivity (or resistance) of the wire.
However, as the frequency increases, the resistance of the wire may become an
influential factor. \cite{practical_electronics}

One thing that can be done to reduce the resistance caused by skin effects is
to use stranded wire --- the combined surface area of all the individual wires
within the conductor is greater than the surface area for a solid-core wire
of the same diameter. \cite{practical_electronics}

\subsection{Batteries}
A battery is made up of a number of cells. Each cell contains a positive
terminal, or \emph{cathode}, and a negative terminal, or \emph{anode}. (Note
that most other devices treat \emph{anodes} as positive terminals and
\emph{cathodes} as negative terminals.) \cite{practical_electronics}

Batteries are classified into 2 types:
\begin{description}
	\item[Primary] Batteries of this type cannot be recharged.
	\item[Secondary] Batteries of this type can be recharged and reused.

\subsubsection{Supercapacitor}
Supercapacitor is a cross between a capacitor and a battery. It resembles a
regular capacitor, but uses special electrodes and some electrolytes. There are
three kinds of electrode material found in a supercapacitor:
high-surface-area-activated carbons, metal oxide, and conducting polymers. The
one using high-surface-area-activated carbons is the most economical to
manufacture. \cite{practical_electronics}

Limitations include an inability to use the full energy spectrum --- depending
on the application, not all energy is available. A supercapacitor has low
energy density, typically holding \(1/5\)  to \(1/10\) the energy of an
electrochemical battery. Cells have low voltages --- serial connections are
needed to obtain higher voltages. Voltage balancing is required if more than
three capacitors are connected in series. Furthermore, the self-discharge is
considerably higher than that of an electrochemical battery. 
\cite{practical_electronics}

Advantages include a virtually unlimited life cycle --- supercapacitors are not
subject to the wear and aging experienced by electrochemical batteries. Also,
low impedance can enhance pulsed current demands on a battery when placed in
parallel with the battery. Supercapacitors experience rapid charging --- with
low-impedance versions reaching full charge within seconds. The charge method
is simple --- the voltage-limiting circuit compensates for self-discharge.
\cite{practical_electronics}

\subsubsection{Battery Capacity}
Batteries are given a capacity rating that indicates how much electrical energy
they are capable of delivering over a period of time. The capacity rating is
specified in terms of ampere-hours (\unit{\ampere\hour}) and millampere-hours
(\unit{\milli\ampere\hour}). \cite{practical_electronics}

\subsubsection{C Rating}
The charge and discharge currents of a battery are measured in capacity rating
or C rating. The capacity represents the efficiency of a battery to store
energy and its ability to transfer this energy to a load. Most portable
batteries, with the exception of lead-acid, are rated at 1C. A discharge rate
of 1C draws a current equal to the rated capacity that takes one hour. For
example, a battery rated at 1000 \unit{\milli\ampere\hour} provides 1000
\unit{\milli\ampere} for 1 hour if discharged at 1C rate. The same battery at
0.5C provides 500 \unit{\milli\ampere} for 2 hours. At 2C, the same battery
delivers 2000 \unit{\milli\ampere} for 30 minutes. 1C is often referred to as a
1-hour discharge; 0.5C would be 2 hours, and 0.1C would be a 10-hour discharge.
The discrepancy in C rates between different batteries is largely dependent on
the internal resistance. \cite{practical_electronics}

\end{wraptable}
Batteries have an internal resistance that is a result of the imperfect
conducting elements that make up the battery (resistance in electrodes and
electrolytes). Though the internal resistance may appear low (around
0.1\unit{\ohm} for an AA alkaline battery, or 1 to 2\unit{\ohm} for a
9\unit{\volt} alkaline battery), it can cause a noticeable drop in output
voltage if a low-resistance (high-current) load is attached to it. Without a
load, we can measure the open-circuit voltage of a battery. This voltage is
essentially equal to the battery's rated nominal voltage --- the voltmeter has
such a high input resistance that it draws practically no current, so there is
no appreciable voltage drop. However, if we attach a load to the battery, the
output terminal voltage of the battery drops. By treating the internal
resistance Rin and the load resistance Rload as a voltage divider, you can
calculate the true output voltage present across the load.
\cite{practical_electronics}

Batteries with large internal resistances show poor performance in supplying
high current pulses. Internal resistance also increases as the battery
discharges. \cite{practical_electronics}
